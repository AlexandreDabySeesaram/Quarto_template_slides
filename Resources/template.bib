  abstract = {Optimization of manufacturing processes or structures involves the optimal choice of many parameters (process parameters, material parameters or geometrical parameters). Usual strategies proceed by defining a trial choice of those parameters and then solving the resulting model. Then, an appropriate cost function is evaluated and its optimality checked. While the optimum is not reached, the process parameters should be updated by using an appropriate optimization procedure, and then the model must be solved again for the updated process parameters. Thus, a direct numerical solution is needed for each choice of the process parameters, with the subsequent impact on the computing time. In this work we focus on shape optimization that involves the appropriate choice of some parameters defining the problem geometry. The main objective of this work is to describe an original approach for computing an off-line parametric solution. That is, a solution able to include information for different parameter values and also allowing to compute readily the sensitivities. The curse of dimensionality is circumvented by invoking the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) introduced in former works, which is applied here to compute geometrically parametrized solutions.},

The discrete version of the POD, which is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices, is described in some detail. The continuous version of the POD is outlined. Low-rank approximations to data using the SVD are discussed. The SVD and the eigenvalue decomposition are compared. Two geometric interpretations of the SVD/POD are given. Computational strategies (using standard software) are mentioned. Two numerical examples are provided: one shows low-rank approximations of a surface, and the other demonstrates simple a posteriori analysis of data from a simulated vibroimpact system.

L'idée, développée dans cette thèse, est la construction efficace et rapide d'approximations de ces champs à travers la Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD), une méthode de réduction de modèle. Les résultats, calculés une fois pour toutes, sont stockés dans des abaques virtuels pour une utilisation ultérieure dans un processus d'optimisation. Le problème considéré est paramétrique et les paramètres définissent la géométrie. Ce type de problème est particulièrement adapté à la PGD. En effet, de nombreux travaux ont traité de la résolution de problèmes paramétriques et des premières études ont porté, en particulier, sur la prise en compte de paramètres géométriques. Toutefois, ce qui caractérise nos travaux est d'aller vers des outils aptes à traiter des situations significatives de la complexité des problèmes rencontrés au niveau industriel. En particulier, l'exploitation de codes éléments finis commerciaux est une contrainte majeure. Il a été décidé de développer des méthodes permettant de traiter des problèmes à paramètres géométriques par la PGD, et, en partenariat avec AIRBUS Defence \& Space, d'appliquer ces techniques à un démonstrateur industriel présentant une géométrie complexe (type splines) et de fortes non-linéarités (géométriques, matériaux). Notre démarche a été implémentée dans un process industriel utilisant des codes éléments finis commerciaux. On propose aussi une nouvelle extension de la PGD aux paramètres discrets autorisant la prise en considération, dans une même résolution, de configurations de structures complètement différentes (cas de chargement, matériaux, etc.).},

  abstract = {This work introduces a hybrid approach that combines the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) with deep learning techniques to provide real-time solutions for parametrised mechanics problems. By relying on a tensor decomposition, the proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in parametric computations, enabling efficient handling of high-dimensional problems across multiple physics and configurations. Each mode in the tensor decomposition is generated by a sparse neural network within the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework presented in Part I, where network parameters are constrained to replicate the classical shape functions used in the Finite Element Method. This constraint enhances the interpretability of the model, facilitating transfer learning, which improves significantly the robustness and cost of the training process. The FENNI framework also enables finding the optimal spatial and parametric discretisation dynamically during training, which accounts to optimising the model's architecture on the fly. This hybrid framework offers a flexible and interpretable solution for real-time surrogate modelling. We highlight the efficiency of the FENNI-PGD approach through 1D and 2D benchmark problems, validating its performance against analytical and numerical reference solutions. The framework is illustrated through linear and non-linear elasticity problems, showing the flexibility of the method in terms of changes in physics.},

A hybrid approach is proposed to solve the nonlinear behaviour in the temporal domain, while the mechanical equilibrium is solved using a frequency strategy coupled with model-order reduction methods. In order to employ the fast Fourier transform (FFT) robustly for the transient regime, artificial numerical damping is used. The reduced-order hybrid temporal-frequency approach is investigated for two- and three-dimensional applications; it appears as a robust and proficient technique to simulate structures under transient dynamic loadings until failure.},

We discuss the automatic generation of first- and second-order shape derivatives for unconstrained model problems as well as for more realistic problems that are constrained by different types of partial differential equations. We consider linear as well as nonlinear problems and also problems which are posed on surfaces. In numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy of the computed derivatives via a Taylor test. Finally, we present first- and second-order shape optimisation algorithms and illustrate them for several numerical optimisation examples ranging from nonlinear elasticity to Maxwell’s equations.},

We propose to solve this problem by using the finite element method and the non-linear LATIN solver. Basically, this non-linear solver assumes a space–time separated representation presaging nowadays PGD strategies. We extend this family of solvers to frictional engineering applications with reduced subspaces and no prior knowledge about the solution (contrary to a posteriori model reduction techniques). Hereinafter, a hybrid a priori/a posteriori LATIN-PGD formulation for frictional contact problems is proposed. Indeed, the suggested algorithm may or may not start with an initial guess of the reduced basis and is able to enrich the basis in order to reach a given level of accuracy. Moreover, it provides progressively the solution of the considered problem into a quasi-optimal space–time separated form compared to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Some examples are provided in order to illustrate the efficiency and quasi-optimality of the proposed a priori reduced basis LATIN solver.},

In this study, we show that fibrosis induced by bleomycin injury in the murine lung locally increases median tissue stiffness sixfold relative to normal lung parenchyma. Across this pathophysiological stiffness range, cultured lung fibroblasts transition from a surprisingly quiescent state to progressive increases in proliferation and matrix synthesis, accompanied by coordinated decreases in matrix proteolytic gene expression. Increasing matrix stiffness strongly suppresses fibroblast expression of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) and synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an autocrine inhibitor of fibrogenesis. Exogenous PGE2 or an agonist of the prostanoid EP2 receptor completely counteracts the proliferative and matrix synthetic effects caused by increased stiffness. Together, these results demonstrate a dominant role for normal tissue compliance, acting in part through autocrine PGE2, in maintaining fibroblast quiescence and reveal a feedback relationship between matrix stiffening, COX-2 suppression, and fibroblast activation that promotes and amplifies progressive fibrosis.},

Computational Mechanics, 67:207–230) provides a systematic approach to constructing numerical approximations that can be incorporated into a wide variety of Partial differential equations (PDE) and/or Ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers. This paper presents a framework of the nonlinear finite element based on HiDeNN approximation (nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM). This is enabled by three basic building blocks employing structured deep neural networks: (1) A partial derivative operator block that performs the differentiation of the shape functions with respect to the element coordinates, (2) An r-adaptivity block that improves the local and global convergence properties and (3) A materials derivative block that evaluates the material derivatives of the shape function. While these building blocks can be applied to any element, specific implementations are presented in 1D and 2D to illustrate the application of the deep learning neural network. Two-step optimization schemes are further developed to allow for the capabilities of r-adaptivity and easy integration with any existing FE solver. Numerical examples of 2D and 3D demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear HiDeNN-FEM with r-adaptivity provides much higher accuracy than regular FEM. It also significantly reduces element distortion and suppresses the hourglass mode.},

  abstract = {Reduced basis methods are particularly attractive to use in order to diminish the number of degrees of freedom associated with the approximation of a set of partial differential equations. The main idea is to construct ad hoc basis functions with a large information content. In this note, we propose to develop and analyze reduced basis methods for simulating hierarchical flow systems, which is of relevance for studying flows in a network of pipes, an example being a set of arteries or veins. We propose to decompose the geometry into generic parts (e.g., pipes and bifurcations), and to contruct a reduced basis for these generic parts by considering representative geometric snapshots. The global system is constructed by gluing the individual basis solutions together via Lagrange multipliers.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has revolutionized the video game industry by providing interactive, three-dimensional visualization. Interestingly, AR technology has only been sparsely used in scientific visualization. This is, at least in part, due to the significant technical challenges previously associated with creating and accessing such models. To ease access to AR for the scientific community, we introduce a novel visualization pipeline with which they can create and render AR models. We demonstrate our pipeline by means of finite element results, but note that our pipeline is generally applicable to data that may be represented through meshed surfaces. Specifically, we use two open-source software packages, ParaView and Blender. The models are then rendered through the ¡model-viewer¿ platform, which we access through Android and iOS smartphones. To demonstrate our pipeline, we build AR models from static and time-series results of finite element simulations discretized with continuum, shell, and beam elements. Moreover, we openly provide python scripts to automate this process. Thus, others may use our framework to create and render AR models for their own research and teaching activities.},

This approach is based upon the use of proper generalized decomposition techniques, a generalization of PODs. Proper generalized decomposition techniques can be considered as a means of a priori model order reduction and provides a physics-based meta-model without the need for prior computer experiments. The suggested strategy is thus composed of an offline phase, in which a general meta-model is computed, and an online evaluation phase in which the results are obtained at real time. Results are provided that show the potential of the proposed technique, together with some benchmark test that shows the accuracy of the method. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Over the past years, model reduction techniques have become a necessary path for the reduction of computational requirements in the numerical simulation of complex models. A family of a priori model reduction techniques, called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) methods, are receiving a growing interest. These methods rely on the a priori construction of separated variables representations of the solution of models defined in tensor product spaces. They can be interpreted as generalizations of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the a priori construction of such separated representations. In this paper, we introduce and study different definitions of PGD for the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. We review classical definitions of PGD based on Galerkin or Minimal Residual formulations and we propose and discuss several improvements for these classical definitions. We give an interpretation of optimal decompositions as the solution of pseudo-eigenproblems. We also introduce a new definition of PGD, called Minimax PGD, which can be interpreted as a Petrov–Galerkin model reduction technique, where test and trial reduced basis functions are related by an adjoint problem. This new definition improves convergence properties of separated representations with respect to a chosen metric. It coincides with a classical POD for degenerate time-dependent partial differential equations. For the numerical construction of each PGD, we propose algorithms inspired from the solution of eigenproblems. Several numerical examples illustrate and compare the different definitions of PGD on transient advection–diffusion–reaction equations.},

  abstract = {We propose the Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) that can be tuned to have superior accuracy, higher smoothness, and faster convergence rates like higher order finite element methods (FEM) while using only linear element’s degrees of freedom. This is based on our newly developed convolution interpolation theory (Lu et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) and this article focuses on the deep-learning interpretation of C-HiDeNN with graphics processing unit (GPU) programming using JAX library in Python. Instead of increasing the degrees of freedom like higher order FEM, C-HiDeNN takes advantage of neighboring elements to construct the so-called convolution patch functions. The computational overhead of C-HiDeNN is reduced by GPU programming and the total solution time is brought down to the same order as commercial FEM software running on a CPU, however, with orders of magnitude better accuracy and faster convergence rates. C-HiDeNN is locking-free regardless of element types (even with 3-node triangular elements or 4-node tetrahedral elements). C-HiDeNN is also capable of r-h-p-mesh adaptivity like its predecessor HiDeNN (Zhang et al. in Comput Mech 67:207–230, 2021) with additional “a” (dilation parameter) adaptivity that stems from the convolution patch function and “p” adaptivity with higher accuracy and with the same degrees of freedom as that of the linear finite elements. C-HiDeNN potentially has myriad future applications in multiscale analysis, additive and advanced manufacturing process simulations, and high-resolution topology optimization. Details on these applications can be found in the companion papers (Lu et al. 2023; Saha et al. in Comput Mech, 2023; Li et al. in Comput Mech, 2023) published in this special issue.},

In particular, the large compliance and the porosity of the pulmonary tissue are critical for lung inflation and air inhalation, and the diaphragm, the pleura, the rib cage and intercostal muscles all play a role in delivering and controlling the breathing driving forces. In this paper, we introduce a novel poromechanical model of the lungs. The constitutive law is derived within a general poromechanics theory via the formulation of lung-specific assumptions, leading to a hyperelastic potential reproducing the volume response of the pulmonary mixture to a change of pressure. Moreover, physiological boundary conditions are formulated to account for the interaction of the lungs with their surroundings, including a following pressure and bilateral frictionless contact. A strategy is established to estimate the unloaded configuration from a given loaded state, with a particular focus on ensuring a positive porosity. Finally, we illustrate through several realistic examples the relevance of our model and its potential clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Computational assistance gains increasing importance in the field of medical surgery. As an example, in the present work, we look at functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Simulations for surgery training programs or online support during surgeries require simulation tools which are characterized by a preferably short simulation time (real time) and a high degree of accuracy. The nonlinear finite element method is most suitable to yield qualitatively and quantitatively reliable results. The problem is, however, to achieve such results in real time. One possibility to reach both, short computational time and high accuracy, is to combine model reduction and finite element techniques. Therefore, in this paper, various projection-based model reduction methods are discussed and compared with respect to their possible application in biomechanics. The modal basis, the load-dependent Ritz and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method were used to reduce the model of a cube under compression considering different material nonlinearities and large deformations. The POD method led to the lowest errors in displacement and stress while providing the largest reduction in CPU time. Further, the influence of different POD parameters was investigated. According to this study, the snapshots upon which the POD is based had to agree as closely as possible with the original deformation of the reduced system. The POD method applied to the finite element model of an inferior turbinate led to an adequate accuracy for surgery simulations within less than one-third of the computational time of the unreduced finite element simulation.},

The principle is to optimise the structure of a 3D printed composite consisting of a geometrically tunable fibre embedded in a soft matrix. Physiological features are extracted from experimental stress-strain curves of several biological soft tissues. Then, using a cubic Bézier curve as the composite inner fibre, we optimised its geometric parameters, amplitude and height, to generate a specimen that exhibits a stress-strain curve in accordance with the extracted features of tensile tests. From this first phase, we created a database of specimen geometries that can be used to reproduce a wide variety of biological soft tissues. We applied this process to two soft tissues with very different behaviours: the mandibular periosteum and the calvarial periosteum. The results show that our method can successfully reproduce the mechanical behaviour of these tissues. This highlights the versatility of this approach and demonstrates that it can be extended to mimic various biological soft tissues.},

  abstract = {We present the Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation (FENNI) framework, a sparse neural network architecture extending previous work on Embedded Finite Element Neural Networks (EFENN) introduced with the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Networks (HiDeNN). Due to their mesh-based structure, EFENN requires significantly fewer trainable parameters than fully connected neural networks, with individual weights and biases having a clear interpretation. Our FENNI framework, within the EFENN framework, brings improvements to the HiDeNN approach. First, we propose a reference element-based architecture where shape functions are defined on a reference element, enabling variability in interpolation functions and straightforward use of Gaussian quadrature rules for evaluating the loss function. Second, we propose a pragmatic multigrid training strategy based on the framework's interpretability. Third, HiDeNN's combined rh-adaptivity is extended from 1D to 2D, with a new Jacobian-based criterion for adding nodes combining h- and r-adaptivity. From a deep learning perspective, adaptive mesh behavior through rh-adaptivity and the multigrid approach correspond to transfer learning, enabling FENNI to optimize the network's architecture dynamically during training. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated on 1D and 2D test cases, where its accuracy and computational cost are compared against an analytical solution and a classical FEM solver. On these cases, the multigrid training strategy drastically improves the training stage's efficiency and robustness. Finally, we introduce a variational loss within the EFENN framework, showing that it performs as well as energy-based losses and outperforms residual-based losses. This framework is extended to surrogate modeling over the parametric space in Part II.},

  abstract = {The human auditory system is designed to capture and encode sounds from our surroundings and conspecifics. However, the precise mechanisms by which it adaptively extracts the most important spectro-temporal information from sounds are still not fully understood. Previous auditory models have explained sound encoding at the cochlear level using static filter banks, but this vision is incompatible with the nonlinear and adaptive properties of the auditory system. Here we propose an approach that considers the cochlear processes as envelope interpolations inspired by cochlear physiology. It unifies linear and nonlinear adaptive behaviors into a single comprehensive framework that provides a data-driven understanding of auditory coding. It allows simulating a broad range of psychophysical phenomena from virtual pitches and combination tones to consonance and dissonance of harmonic sounds. It further predicts the properties of the cochlear filters such as frequency selectivity. Here we propose a possible link between the parameters of the model and the density of hair cells on the basilar membrane. Cascaded Envelope Interpolation may lead to improvements in sound processing for hearing aids by providing a non-linear, data-driven, way to preprocessing of acoustic signals consistent with peripheral processes.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical deep-learning neural network (HiDeNN) is systematically developed through the construction of structured deep neural networks (DNNs) in a hierarchical manner, and a special case of HiDeNN for representing Finite Element Method (or HiDeNN-FEM in short) is established. In HiDeNN-FEM, weights and biases are functions of the nodal positions, hence the training process in HiDeNN-FEM includes the optimization of the nodal coordinates. This is the spirit of r-adaptivity, and it increases both the local and global accuracy of the interpolants. By fixing the number of hidden layers and increasing the number of neurons by training the DNNs, rh-adaptivity can be achieved, which leads to further improvement of the accuracy for the solutions. The generalization of rational functions is achieved by the development of three fundamental building blocks of constructing deep hierarchical neural networks. The three building blocks are linear functions, multiplication, and inversion. With these building blocks, the class of deep learning interpolation functions are demonstrated for interpolation theories such as Lagrange polynomials, NURBS, isogeometric, reproducing kernel particle method, and others. In HiDeNN-FEM, enrichment functions through the multiplication of neurons is equivalent to the enrichment in standard finite element methods, that is, generalized, extended, and partition of unity finite element methods. Numerical examples performed by HiDeNN-FEM exhibit reduced approximation error compared with the standard FEM. Finally, an outlook for the generalized HiDeNN to high-order continuity for multiple dimensions and topology optimizations are illustrated through the hierarchy of the proposed DNNs.},
